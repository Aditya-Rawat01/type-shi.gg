Authentication is done with the help of better auth library.

keypoints:
email is unique in the schema generated by the better auth library so checking the user exists is done by email.


check whether the better auth also provides the scheduled cleanup for the sessions stored in the db



things to change:
change the google oAuth client id's authorized redirect url when deployed.
change the github homepage url and authorization callback url to that deployed url as well.
also change them in the projects as well.

observations:
single user can have multiple accounts (by credential/github/google)
